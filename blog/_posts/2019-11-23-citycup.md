I spent a weekend with the most brilliant minds in Spain coming from the best Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Physics programs all over Spain for [McKinsey's City Cup](https://www.mckinsey.com/careers/the-city-cup/overview).

I teamed up with two of the best and most hardworking Data Scientists I have ever met. We finished runners up at the Madrid edition.

Thanks for a great weekend!
