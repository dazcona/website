title: I am a Fulbrighter!
date: 2017-06-01

I have been awarded with a [Fulbright][fulbright] scholarship to conduct research as a visiting scholar in [Arizona State University][asu]. I could not be happier!

I will be researching the differences in learner behaviour in Computer Science between Ireland and the US, and how student collaboration with a university comprising such a large student body can be enabled. I will be based in the University Technology Office, the School of Computing and the Office of the Provost. That way, I will be able to gather a large student digital footprint, extract and identify patterns that can form insights we can feed back to students at ASU. My advisors will be [John Rome](https://uto.asu.edu/about/john-rome) and [Arthur Blakemore](https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/44586).

The Program encourages cultural exchange as well as educational. In addition to completing a research project, I will be an Irish Ambassador during my time in the US. I will return to Ireland to share the knowledge I have gained there.
