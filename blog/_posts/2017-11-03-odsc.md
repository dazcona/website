title: Open Data Science Conference in San Francisco
date: 2017-11-03

I got a scholarship from [ODSC][odsc] Selection Committee to attend their San Francisco Conference as an invited student with my [Fulbright][fulbright] friend Alicia Tan. 

It was an amazing experience where I got to listen and learn from a number of renowned data scientists such as D.J. Patil and companies like Airbnb, Netflix, IBM or Linkedin. A not-to-be-missed Industry conference!

Check out the slides and material from the sessions [here](https://odsc.com/california/odsc-west-2017-details).
