title: Amazon ReInvent 2017!

I attended 2017 Amazon's ReInvent Conference in Las Vegas. My advisor at [Arizona State University][asu], [John Rome](https://uto.asu.edu/about/john-rome), presented how ASU is working with Amazon to create the first voice-enabled campus.

The voice-enabled devices becoming more prevalent in our connected world, it only makes sense to bring these capabilities to a university campus. 

I spent my time in the conference between The Venetian and Aria hotels as I focused on the AI & Machine Learning sessions.
