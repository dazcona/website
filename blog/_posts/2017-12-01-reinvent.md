I attended 2017 Amazon's ReInvent Conference in Las Vegas. My advisor at [Arizona State University][asu], [John Rome](https://uto.asu.edu/about/john-rome), presented how ASU is working with Amazon to create the first voice-enabled campus. Read more details [here](https://asunow.asu.edu/20170817-asu-news-asu-amazon-dots-tooker-house). The voice-enabled devices becoming more prevalent in our connected world, it only makes sense to bring these capabilities to a university campus. 

I spent my time in the conference between The Venetian and Aria hotels as I focused on the AI & Machine Learning sessions. Amazon presented a number of new AI offerings such as text to speech and companies like Netflix or Airbnb showcased how they are making use of Amazon services to monitor and personalized their products.
