title: Teaching coding to kids in a fun way!

Higher Education in the US is unfortunately only accessible to a minority. I have been volunteering in a local low-income middle-school in the Tempe (Arizona, US) where I lead a group of students and we teach students technology in a fun way! 

We use [Raspberry Pis][pi] and small robots to spark their interest and motivate them to follow a career in STEM. I am just trying to convince them this is something they can achieve if they put their minds into it! 

We got awarded funding by [ASU Changemaker][changemaker] to continue our mission and buy more equipment (we donate it to the schools afterwards). In addition, I enabled collaboration to apply state-of-the-art Eductional Technology research using [Prof Sharon Hsiao][sharon]’s team’s Augmented Reality technology on those classrooms.
