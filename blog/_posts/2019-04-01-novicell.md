I was awarded Geek of the Year by [Novicell][novicell], the first prize of their Student Geek Challenge 2018. Further details can be found on their Facebook's page: https://www.facebook.com/StudentGeekChallenge/

The project I submitted was Code Assistant. Code Assistant is Whatsapp Artificial Intelligence ChatBot to support learning of computer programming for college students. I presented a demo at the 9th Learning Analytics & Knowledge 2019 Conference in Arizona, USA where I finished runners up. Find all the details at my Github's [repo][repo].
