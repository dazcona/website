This academic year I have the opportunity to inmerse myself in the American culture while on my [Fulbright][fulbright] program. I could not be more thankful to my advisor [John Rome](https://uto.asu.edu/about/john-rome) and his family for their continous support, and all the friends and people I met here in the US. Thank you!
