It is time to say goodbye!

My time here has been incredibly enriching. Coming to the US with the Fulbright program is already a recognition for many people here, not only in Academia. It always sparks an interest and during my time here I got asked many questions around the program, Ireland and why I chose to come to Arizona!

Before heading back to Europe to continue my PhD, I had a bit of time to say goodbye to my friends. My host, [John Rome][john], and his family, really made me feel at home. They helped me in so many ways! I will always be grateful to them. [Prof. Sharon Hsiao][sharon] has also supported me along the way and I had the chance to learn a lot from her and her team, not only academically but personally. I got to meet so many people and made friends for life! I can't really count the amazing experiences we lived here: countless trips, dinners and hikes.
