title: 2018 Higher Education Data Warehousing (HEDW)
date: 2018-04-10

I attended the 2018 [Higher Education Data Warehousing Forum][web] at Oregon State University with a team from ASU's [University Technology Office][uto]. 

It was a very enriching experience where I learned how universities, such as Oregon State University or Ohio State University, are building infrastructures to store student data and make good use of it using a Cloud provider like Amazon's AWS. For instance, it allows researchers like me to extract insights from this data lake and feed them back to students and Faculty.

Before driving to Corvallis (Oregon) for HEDW, we spent the weekend in Portland where we had the chance to visit their amazing local breweries, Voodoo Doughnut and Multnomah Falls!
