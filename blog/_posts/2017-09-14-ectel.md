In September 2017, I attended the 12th. European Conference on Technology Enchanced Learning in Estonia. It was a great experience where I presented some of my work around detecting patterns of success on a variety of Computer Science courses. 

I got to meet and speak with a number of researchers and academics on the field such as Prof Stephanie Teasley who leads cutting-edge research lab at the University of Michigan on personalized learning.
