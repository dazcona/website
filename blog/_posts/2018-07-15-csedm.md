title: CSEDM workshop organization at EDM 2018
date: 2018-07-15

In July 2018, I co-organized and presented at the Educational Data Mining in Computer Science Education ([CSEDM 2018][csedm]) Workshop. This was done in conjunction with [EDM 2018][edm] at The University at Buffalo, New York, United States. The objective of the workshop was to facilitate a discussion among our research community around Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Computer Science Education. 

The workshop was a success with many presentations from top researchers in the area, the support of the [SPLICE][splice] community, break out sessions around particular topics and also technical contributions in a demo format. Check out the [website][csedm] for all the papers, slides and contributions!
