title: Hi Taoiseach!

I had the opportunity to showcase my work at this year's [Data Summit][summit] in Dublin. The theme of this year's summit was "What does the Data Society mean to you?" and presented an opportunity for hear leading international, European and Irish speakers debate the social, technical, ethical and cultural issues that arise in the context of our world of total connectivity. 

[ADAPT][adapt] and [Insight][insight] researchers had posters displaying the innovative research in data technology from both centres, examples of which ranged from sentiment analysis of tweets on RTE's 2016 general election and budget, to visualising financial data through virtual reality.

I was lucky enough to say hi to the newly appointed Taoiseach, Leo Varardkar, on his first full day in office.
