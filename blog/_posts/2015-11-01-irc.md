title: Making the move From Industry to Academia
date: 2015-11-01

I was set for a career working in the IT industry with a good, secure position in IBM Ireland. While working for IBM I pursued a Masters in Data Analytics at [Dublin City University][dcu] on a part-time basis. I also started interacting with researchers at DCU such as my current advisor [Prof Alan Smeaton][asmeaton] and a Master's lecturer Kevin Casey. The power and potential of applying Artificial Intelligence techniques to areas like Education captivated me and I decided to pursue a PhD in DCU with my advisor's encouragement and backing.

I was awarded the [Irish Research Council][irc] Postgraduate Scholarship Program in partnership with the [National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching & Learning in Higher Education][natforum].

I have so many good memories from my time at IBM in Belgium and Ireland where I worked for more than three years and a half and leave great friends and colleagues. At the same time, I could not be more excited of starting a new chapter in my life where I will focus on learning and making a small contribution to the world's knowledge.
