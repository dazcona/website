I was invited to speak at [ASU's EdPlus][edplus] where I talked about my projects in Educational Data Mining & Personalized Learning, Representational Learning using embeddings, Transfer Learning for image analysis and Network Representations.

I received great feedback and will continue the collaboration with EdPlus's [Action Lab][actionlab]!

### Take-aways from my talk:
* Learning is multimodal and happens everywhere!
* Applying state-of-the-art Data Science approaches to Computer Science Education is useful & fun!
* Predictive Modelling using Multimodal Learning Analytics is successfully leveraged to personalize learning
* Meaningful interventions can be employed using Networks and Hidden Markov Model approaches
