title: Prometheus at the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2018 US Finals!
date: 2018-05-06
---

Recently, I teamed up with two friends (one is an Argentinian Fulbrighter) and submitted a project to [Microsoft 2018 Imagineâ€™s Cup][cup]. We developed, [Prometheus][prometheus], a Fire Detection software powered by AI. We combine surveillance drone capabilities with concepts of Deep Learning to create software that detects early-stage wildfires.

We were shortlisted to the US finals and travelled to San Francisco where we made it to the world finals and won the best use of AI award. See [2018 U.S. Imagine Cup Winners Announced!

More coming up soon when we go to Seattle in July for the world finals!
