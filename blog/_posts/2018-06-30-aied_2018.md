In June 2018, I attended the 19th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education ([AIED 2018][aied]) in London, UK. It was a great experience where I presented some of my work around modelling student learning in McGrawHill's [ALEKS][aleks] platform used for Arizona State University's [GFA][gfa] Math courses.

I was nominated to Best Student Poster, see details [here](https://aied2018.utscic.edu.au/accepted-papers/#A). Talking to many researchers in the area was an incredible experience!
