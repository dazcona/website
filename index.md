# About Me
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics][icda] at [Dublin City University][dcu]. During my doctoral studies, I was supervised by [Prof Alan Smeaton][asmeaton] and I visited [Arizona State University][asu] as a [Fulbright][fulbright] research scholar. 

I am a computing enthusiast and am passionate about research, education and teaching. I love to explore new fields, learn new technologies, and challenge myself in a way that allows me to make an impact on society. I also like sports, travelling, meeting people and learning from new cultures.

My research is in Artificial Intelligence and Applied Machine Learning. I worked on a variety of projects; from Computer Science Education using traditional Machine Learning and embeddings to fire finding drones with Computer Vision and transfer learning to Fintech approaches combining banking and social data.
