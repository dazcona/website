# ~$ whoami
I am a PhD Candidate supervised by [Prof Alan Smeaton][asmeaton] in the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics][icda] at [Dublin City University][dcu] in Ireland. During my doctoral studies, I visited [Arizona State University][asu] as a [Fulbright][fulbright] research scholar. 

My research focuses on personalizing Computer Science Education. I use student data footprints to predict student performance and recommend the most suitable learning resources to enhance their academic experience.
